[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/pdf/golifx/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/pdf/golifx/latest) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/pdf/golifx?status.svg)](http://godoc.org/github.com/pdf/golifx) ![License-MIT](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-red.svg)

__Note:__ This library is at a moderately early stage - functionality is quite
solid, but the V2 protocol implementation needs documentation and tests.

You may find binaries for a trivial CLI application that allows querying and
controlling your LIFX devices under [releases](https://github.com/pdf/golifx/releases/latest).

Alternatively, if you have Go installed, you may install the `lifx` command from
source like so:

```shell
go get -u github.com/pdf/golifx/cmd/lifx
```

The `lifx` command will be available at `${GOPATH}/bin/lifx`
