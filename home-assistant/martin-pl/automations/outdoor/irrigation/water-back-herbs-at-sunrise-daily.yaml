# Irrigation Automations
## Daily Sunrise Water
# Morning Water -> All Herbs and Drippers
#   Only if <2mm rain forcast and no rain so far
#   Heat multiplier (e.g. 2x 20deg days) vs (2x 40deg days)
#     increase water amount?
#     decrease water frequency?
#     factor in moisture levels?
#       (a * prev max) + (b * forecast max) + (c * moisture)
#     if multiplier < threshold, don't water.
#     20 + 33 + -30 = 23
#     20 + 20 + -50 = -10
#     33 + 33 + -10 = 56

# Watering Factor:
#   Days since last water (Rain, Sprinkler)
#   Temperature Avg
#   Soil Moisture

# Herbs - Summer Daytime Spritz
#   Only if moisture <20% OR temp > 30deg
#   Only if <5mm rain forcast

# Front Herbs: Sunrise (5 min)
# Back Herbs: Sunrise  (5 min)
#   conditions:
#     - moisture < 40%
#     - <2mm rain forcast

# Front Drippers: Sunrise + 10min (15min) (every 3rd day winter)
# Back Drippers: Sunrise + 10min (15min) (every 3rd day winter)
#  conditions:
#     - <2mm rain forcast
#    median temp 26deg: Every day
