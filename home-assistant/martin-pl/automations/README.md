## Automations

Library of automations that I run within my apartment

Directory structure is categorised by trigger location/area. e.g. A global action triggered by a local input (i.e. button) will be categorised by the location/area of the button. Automations within these categories can be grouped within sub-categories or entities (e.g. `living_room/lamp`)

Triggers which are global, or do not fit within a single room, should be placed at the top level in their own category (e.g. `doorbell/*`, `presence/*`)
